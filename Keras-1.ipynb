    "# Lung Nodule Analysis \n",
    "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Screening high risk individuals for lung cancer with low-dose CT scans is now being implemented in the United States and other countries are expected to follow soon. In CT lung cancer screening, millions of CT scans will have to be analyzed, which is an enormous burden for radiologists. Therefore, there is a lot of interest in development of computer algorithms to optimize cancer screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/luna16_image.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A vital first step in the analysis of lung cancer CT scans is the detection of pulmonary nodules, which may or may not represent early stage lung cancer. Many Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) systems have already been proposed for this task. \n",
    "\n",
    "The LIDC/IDRI data set is publicly available, including the ground-truth annotations of nodules performed by four radiologists.\n",
    "\n",
    "This practical session is inspired from the challenge [LUNA16](https://luna16.grand-challenge.org/home/), which focused on a large-scale evaluation of automatic nodule detection algorithms on the LIDC/IDRI data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/lung_cancer1.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using LIDC/IDRI data set in this practical session\n",
    "\n",
    "For the needs of this practical session, we will look for an algorithm that only determines the likelihood for a given location in a CT scan to contain a pulmonary nodule. Furthermore, we have included a very small part of the LIDC/IDRI data set and we will use only a slice of suspicious regions of a CT scan.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data augmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Originally our dataset was very unbalanced. There were a lot samples of non-nodules (negatives) but very few samples of nodules (positives). Machine learning algorithms and specifically neural networks and convolutional neural networks require to be trained on balanced dataset, meaning all the classes should be equally represented in the training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using data augmentation methods (**rotation and translation**), positive samples were massively augmented in order to balance the two classes (nodules and non-nodules)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ground Truth data\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical data are variables that contain label values rather than numeric values. In our dataset, a sample can represent a nodule or a non-nodule area, so initially we have our ground truth data in a categorical form. Many machine learning algorithms cannot operate on label data directly. They require all input variables to be numeric. This means that categorical data must be converted to a numerical form. This involves two steps:\n",
    "1. Integer Encoding\n",
    "2. One-Hot Encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first step, each unique category value is assigned an integer value. That's why in our dataset, a sample which represents a nodule will have as a label **1** and a sample which represents a non-nodule area will have as a label **0**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our case, this enconding step would be enough since we have only two categories. However, in a more general problem with more than two classes, using this encoding allows the model to assume a natural ordering between categories which may result in poor performance or unexpected results. That's why, one hot encoding can be appled to the integer representation. This is where the integer encoded variable is removed and a new binary variable is added for each unique integer value. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, a  nodule will be represented by the binary variable [1,0] and a non-nodule area by the binary variable [0,1].\n",

    "First of all, separate the test set from the train set. Keep 10% of your samples as a test-set. (**Tip:** Use sklearn **train_test_split** function.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since 3D CNNs need a lot of computation power, we will convert our problem to 2D. Instead of using all the 6 CT slices, we will use only the 3rd CT slice. Therefore, from each sample, the 3rd slice wiil be extracted and further preprocessed. In addition, our values currently range from -1024 HU to around 2000 HU. Anything above 400 is not interesting to us, as these are simply bones with different radiodensity. A commonly used set of thresholds to normalize between is -1000 and 400. Finally the labels will be properly encoded to be used for training and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your pre-processing tasks as python functions (listed below) and in the end create a pipeline for each sample which will be also implemented as a function.\n",
    "1. Function loading the .mhd image as a numpy array.\n",
    "2. Function extracting the 3rd slice of a patch. The final form of patches should be a numpy array of size **20x20** pixels.\n",
    "3. Function normalizing the dataset.\n",
    "The unit of measurement in CT scans is the **Hounsfield Unit (HU)**, which is a measure of radiodensity. CT scanners are carefully calibrated to accurately measure this. From Wikipedia:\n",

    "When you install TensorFlow, you automatically also install <b>Tensorboard</b>. During or after training you can use  it  to visualize the network and its performance. For the next tasks, <b>include both the loss and the accuracy graphs for training and also for evaluating the test-set</b>. A simple way to attach these graphs to jupyter notebook is to use Window's Snipping Tool or a similar application. Then display it either using a plain HTML ```<img src>``` or by using ```IPython.display.Image``` and ```IPython.core.display.HTML```. Don't forget to submit the actual image file with your .ipynb as the image is not saved in the notebook, it is just linked.\n",

    "As can be seen in the accuracy it still tend to rise after 10 Epochs. Therefor a larger amount of epochs can be adviced. However as can be seen the curve does become more stable here and the amount of accuracy gain needs to be balanced with the speed of the model when increasing the amount of epochs. Taking this into account we can conclude that from 10 epochs a sort of plateau level for the accuracy is reached and that this amount would be sufficient. "

    "Using dropout is a  regularisation technique. It randomly drops units during training. The goal is to reduce overfitting and decrease a generalization error. For the values the following scaling was used, 1.0 means no dropout, and 0.0 means no outputs from the layer. It can be clearly see that by increasing dropout level higher accuracy are much faster reached. Also convergence between validation and training accuracy is much faster accomplished."
